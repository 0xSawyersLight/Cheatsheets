# Cheatsheets
<h2>What, why?<h2>
  
Cheatsheets are what I use to function apparently and I feel like most of the cheatsheets are oversatured with just useless minute information of other resources and information that might not be actually useful in a real-life scenario, So I decided to try to make and a cheatsheets that ARE useful that WILL atleast help one person ill attempt to have them not be blaoted with useless information and keep them useful for real activities like CTF's

I hope you find these useful and if you have any feedback please feel free to tell me!
