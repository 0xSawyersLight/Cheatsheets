# Cheatsheets
<h2>What, why?<h2>
Cheatsheets are what I use to to function apparently and I feel like most of the cheatsheetS are oversatured with just compilations of other resources and information that might not be actually useful in a real-life scenario,So I decided to try to make and a cheatsheets that ARE useful, not blaoted with useless information and useful for real activities like CTF's
